# RCHF

RCHF is an elastic supply ERC20 Token with randomized rebasing.

RCHF is a fork of Ampleforth uFragments repository. Credits to
Ampleforth team for implementation of rebasing on the ethereum network.

RCHF inherits appropriate licenses from upstream project.

RCHF implementation consists of 2 contracts.

### RCHF.sol

- Basic ERC20 Token with a rebase function, callable by the contract
  owner.
- Owner can be transferred to allow upgrades to the onchain random
  rebasing implementation.
- Once onchain random rebasing solution has been finalized, contract
  owner will be locked to ensure no party has control and the
  implementation is completely self governed.

### Rebaser.sol:

- Parent contract to RCHF.sol.
- Rebasing at random times within the rebase window (48hrs)
- Applying a randomized lag factor based on the current supply, with a
  function to accelerate increase in supply between 10M and 100M
  RCHFs.
- Rebasing to a price target of \$1.00 USD with a CPI adjustment.
- Retrieve RCHF/USD price from Uniswap v2 onchain interface.

Rebaser.sol is still in active development. Current tasks being worked
on are described below.

Please refer to https://github.com/rchf for latest code updates.

### Onchain Random rebasing implementation:

(as of version 0.8.0)

- Rebaser.sol contains a publicly callable rebase() function.
- Can only be called once per block.
- Will check upto a maximum of the last 250 blocks or the number of
  block since the last call.
- A random number will be generated between 0 and average number of
  blocks for 48hr period.
- Average blocks for 48hr period will be recalculated to account for
  changes in the rate of blocks mined on the network.
- Random number will be compared against number of blocks since last
  rebase.
- As the number of blocks since last rebase increases, the probability
  of the random generated number triggering a rebase will increase.
- The probability distribution function used will result in an average
  rebase of 24hrs over a large sample.
- If there is a rebase trigger, price will be retrieved from Uniswap.
- If price is within current CPI adjusted threshold (eg. +- 5%) no
  rebase will occur.
- If price is outside threshold, supply delta will be calculated based
  on the ratio of current price to target price.
- A random lag factor will be generated and applied to delta:
  - A range will be calculated based on current total supply.
  - If current supply is between 10M and 100M tokens a function will
    be applied to accelerate supply increase to 100M
- New supply delta will now be applied to RCHF token.
- New rebase stats are updated. (These are accessible via a public
  call to Rebaser contract)

## Probability Distribution Function:

### Random rebase (lag and time)

#### Definitions

- A block hash is released at each time t(m)
- N is the expected number of block hashes released in a 48-hour period
- Rebase event timing T occurs at one of the block hash release times {t(1), t(2), … t(N – 1)}

Assuming a block hash is released every 12 seconds on average then:

>     	N = 48 (hours) * 60 (minutes) * 60 (seconds) / 12 (seconds) = 14,400

#### Algorithm

At time T = t(1), the first block hash, H(1), is released:

- Calculate the remainder, R(1), when the block hash H(1) is divided by (N – 1):

  >     	H(1) = q(1) * (N – 1) + R(1),
  >
  > _for some integer q(1)_

- If R(1) = 0 then rebase now
- Otherwise move to the next step

At time T = t(m), the m-th block hash, H(m), is released:

- Calculate the remainder, R(m), when the block hash H(m) is divided by (N – m):

  >     	H(m) = q(m) * (N – m) + R(m),
  >
  > _for some integer q(m)_

- If R(m) = 0 then rebase now
- Otherwise move to the next step

Note that if the algorithm reaches time T = t(N – 1) then the rebase certainly happens at that time.

#### Probabilities and expectations

- H(m) is a very large, randomly generated, number which is much bigger than N
- Therefore R(m) is approximately uniformly distributed on {0, 1, … (N – m – 1)}
- By the properties of uniform distributions:
  >     	P[R(m) = 0] = P[R(m) = 1] = … = P[R(m) = (N – m – 1)] = 1 / (N – m)

>     	P[T = t(1)] = P[R(1) = 0] = 1 / (N – 1)
>
> _since R(1) is approximately uniformly distributed on {0, 1, … (N – 1)}_

>     	P[T = t(2)] = P[T != 1 AND T = 2]
>     		= P[R(1) != 0 AND R(2) = 0]
>     		= P[R(1) != 0] * P[R(2) = 0]
>
> _since R(1) and R(2) are independent_
> = {(N – 2) / (N – 1)} \* {1 / (N – 2)} = 1 / (N – 1)

Similarly, for t = 3, 4, … (N – 1)

>     	P[T = t(m)] = P[T != 1 AND T != 2 … AND T != (m – 1) AND T = m]
>     		= P[R(1) != 0 AND R(2) != 0 … AND R(m - 1) != 0 AND R(m) = 0]
>     		= P[R(1) != 0] * P[R(2) != 0 ] … * P[R(m - 1) != 0] * P[R(m) = 0]
>
> _since R(1), R(2) … R(m - 1), R(m) are all independent_
> = {(N – 2) / (N – 1)} _ {(N – 3) / (N – 2)} _ …
> … _ {(N – m + 2) / (N – m + 1)} _ {1 / (N – m)} = 1 / (N – 1)

So we have **P[T = t(m)] = 1 / (N – 1)** for m in {t(1), t(2), …. t(N – 1)}.
So T is uniformly distributed on {t(1), t(2), … t(N – 1)}.

>     	E[t-1(T)] = 1 * P[t-1(T) = 1] + 2 * P[t-1(T) = 2] … + (N – 2) * P[t-1(T) = (N – 2)] + (N – 1) * P[t-1(T) = (N – 1)]
>     	 = 1 * P[T = t(1)] + 2 * P[T = t(2)] … + (N – 2) * P[T = t(N – 2)] + (N – 1) * P[T = t(N – 1)]
>     	 	= 1 / (N – 1) * {1 + 2 … + (N – 2) + (N – 1)} = N / 2

**The rebase happens on average after N/2 hash block releases.** Since N is the expected number of block hashes released in a 48-hour period, the rebase happens on average after 24 hours.

### Current work in progress BEFORE deploying:

- Enhanced onchain RNG implementation, current R&D into:
  - Combination of 1st layer blockhash and 2nd layer oracle call to
    improve randomness, whilst optimizing the process for gas costs.
  - Reviewing oracle services such as Chainlink's VRF, Randao etc
  - Ethereum 2.0 network update to include a random number every x
    blocks.
- R&D of enhanced probability distribution function, to average rebase
  to 24hrs with reasonable deviations over smaller samples.
- Calculate a weighted average price over time or volume for Uniswap
  pricing.
- Oraclize US CPI inflation figure for price target.
- Gas optimizations.
- Code audit of Rebaser versions before deploying.

As we are in the early stages of development for the Rebaser contract,
the team have decided to perform random rebasing offchain until a
suitable, well reviewed version is ready to be deployed. We are making
the source public to begin this process, with complete transparency.

Onchain randomized rebasing is the priority for RCHF team, but we must
protect all RCHF holders in this short interim period, by only deploying
onchain when we are sure the solution is resistant from any manipulation
or exploitation.
